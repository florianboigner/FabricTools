    "This notebook is an example of how the Power BI Embedded APIs can be used to gather the VisualIDs from a Power BI report. The script connects to a report end embeds it into the Notebook, then it loops through the pages of the reports and extracts visual information, which are then exported to JSON. \n",

    "The visual ID's can e.g. be used together with the logs from the Log Analytics integration, to correlate query events with specific report pages and visuals. \n",

    "- The notebook was developed to be executed locally and currently doesn't work in Microsoft Fabric. \n",
    "- Execute the cells one-by-one. The report needs to be visibly embedded within the notebook before you can execute the last cell to collect the visual IDs.\n",
    "- Each page needs to have at least one visual, as the loop otherwise throws an error.\n",
    "- Please make sure that [powerbiclient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/powerbi-jupyter) is installed."
